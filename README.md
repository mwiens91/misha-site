# misha-site

This is a static site hosted
[here](https://mwiens91.github.io/misha-site/) that uses
[nanogallery2](https://nanogallery2.nanostudio.org/) to display pictures of
my cat Misha. The images are stored in a separate repository
[here](https://github.com/mwiens91/misha-pics/); that repo also contains
a few scripts to generate thumbnails and generate code containing image
metadata for this site.
